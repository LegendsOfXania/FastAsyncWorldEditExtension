## SchematicsExtension

**SchematicsExtension** is a TypeWriter extension that displays WorldEdit schematics â€” or even just a single block â€” to specific players without ever modifying the actual server world.

It is designed for narrative or interactive servers to simulate temporary structures, hallucinations, or glimpses of an altered world â€” all seamlessly and without any permanent impact on the map.

### âœ¨ Features

* Displays WorldEdit schematics (`.schem` files via FAWE)
* Client-side illusions: blocks are only visible to targeted players
* No permanent changes to the world
